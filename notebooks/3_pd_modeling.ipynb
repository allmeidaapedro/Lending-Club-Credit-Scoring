    "## Lending Club Credit Risk Modeling\n",
    "- In this project, I will build three **machine learning** models to predict the three components of expected loss in the context of **credit risk modeling** at the **Lending Club** (a peer-to-peer credit company): **Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD)**. The expected loss will be the product of these elements: **Expected Loss (EL) = PD * EAD * LGD**. These models will be used to stablish a credit policy, deciding wheter to grant a loan or not for new applicants (application model) based on their credit scores and expected losses on loans. By estimating the Expected Loss (EL) from each loan, the Lending Club can also assess the required capital to hold to protect itself against defaults.\n",
    "- The PD modelling encompasses an imbalanced binary classification problem with target being 1 in case of non-default and 0 in case of default (minority class). A Logistic Regression model will be built. \n",
    "- The LGD and EAD modelling encompasses a beta regression problem, that is, a regression task in which the dependent variables are beta distributed, the recovery rate and credit conversion factor, respectively.\n",
    "- The **solution pipeline** is based on the **crisp-dm** framework:\n",

    "## Lending Club\n",
    "- **What is the Lending Club?:**\n",
    "    - LendingClub is a **peer-to-peer lending platform** that facilitates the borrowing and lending of money directly between individuals, without the need for traditional financial institutions such as banks. The platform operates as an online marketplace, connecting borrowers seeking personal loans with investors willing to fund those loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem: Managing Default Risks and Optimizing Returns\n",
    "- **What is the business problem?**\n",
    "    - LendingClub faces a significant business challenge related to **managing default risks effectively** while **optimizing returns** for its investors. The platform facilitates peer-to-peer lending, connecting borrowers with investors, and relies on **accurate risk assessments to maintain a sustainable and profitable lending ecosystem.** Thus, the CEO wants us to provide insights about which factors are associated with credit risk in Lending Club's operations, and to construct models capable of predicting the probability of default for new applicants and possible losses on its loans in order to establish a credit policy, deciding when to grant a loan or not for an applicant. An important observation is that the CEO wants these models to be easy to understand. Since our company works on the internet, making customers happy and being clear is really important. So, we need to be able to explain why we decide to approve or deny a loan.\n",
    "- **Which are the project objectives and benefits?**\n",
    "    1. Identify the factors associated with **credit risk** in the form of business **insights.**\n",
    "    2. Develop an accurate **Probability of Default (PD) Model**, constructing a scorecard. This will allow Lending Club to decide wheter to grant a loan or not to a new applicant (**application model**), based on **credit scores.**\n",
    "    3. Develop **Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) Models**, to estimate the **Expected Loss** in loans. This will allow Lending Club to **hold** sufficient **capital** to protect itself against default in each loan.\n",
    "    4. Improve **risk management** and optimize **returns** by establishing a **credit policy**, trying to balance risk and **ROI** of Lending Club's assets.\n",
    "    5. Apply **model monitoring** and maintenance techniques to safeguard our results from population instability, characterized by significant changes in loan applicants' characteristics. This will allow us to understand whether the built model is still useful in the future or whether the loan applicants characteristics changed significantly, such that we will need to redevelop it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credit Risk Modeling Concepts: The Context of the Problem\n",
    "- **Financial institutions**, like LendingClub and online lending platforms, **make money by lending to people and businesses.** When they lend money, they **charge interest**, which is a significant source of their **profits**. **Managing credit risk well is crucial** for these institutions. This means ensuring that borrowers pay back their loans on time to avoid losses.\n",
    "- **Credit risk** is the possibility that a borrower might not fulfill their financial obligations, leading to a loss for the lender. If a borrower fails to meet the agreed-upon terms, it's called a \"default,\" and it can result in financial losses for the lender. The **default** definition is associated with a time horizon. For example, if a borrower hasn't paid their debt within 90 days of the due date, they are considered in default.\n",
    "- In the credit market, important **rules** help keep things honest and clear. **Basel III** is one such set of rules, making sure banks have **enough money (capital requirements)** and follow **guidelines for assessing loan risks**. The **Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB-A)** lets banks figure out credit risks using concepts like Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD). Another rule, **International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9)**, gives standards for measuring financial assets. It's special because it looks at the chance of a loan not being paid back over its entire life, unlike Basel, which checks it for one year. These rules help banks have enough money, handle risks well, and keep the credit market steady and trustworthy.\n",
    "- The **\"expected loss (EL)\"** is the average estimated loss that a lender can expect from loans that default. It involves three factors: the **probability of default (likelihood of a borrower defaulting)**, **loss given default (portion of the amount the bank is exposed to that can't be recovered in case of default)**, and **exposure at default (potential loss at the time of default, considering the outstanding loan amount and other factors)**.\n",
    "- **LendingClub**, operating as a peer-to-peer lending platform, uses a **\"PD Model/Credit Scoring Model\" to assess borrowers' creditworthiness using credit scores**. This helps determine the **likelihood of loan repayment**, guiding the decision to **approve or deny the loan.** The **required capital to guard against default** for each loan is calculated using **EAD and LGD Models** to estimate the **Expected Loss (EL)**, contributing to minimizing risk in credit operations.\n",
    "- When creating a Credit Scoring Model, which assesses creditworthiness for loan approval, using data available at the time of the application is considered an **\"application model.\"** It is distinct from a \"behavior model.\" This is the model I will build here.\n",
    "- A **\"credit policy\"** is a set of guidelines that financial institutions follow to evaluate and manage lending risk. Factors such as the expected ROI for each loan application, credit scores, risk classes, expected losses, and so on, are included.\n",
    "- **\"Return on Investment (ROI)\"** is a key measure of loan profitability. Balancing ROI with risk is vital for effective credit policy management. While higher-risk loans may offer more significant potential returns, they also come with a higher chance of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **this notebook**, I intend to **construct the Probability of Default (PD) model**, assigning **credit scores** to the applicants, encompassing steps 3, 4, and 5 of the CRISP-DM framework. To achieve this, the insights found in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the details about how the preprocessing will be done will be employed here. **We will preprocess our data, construct the PD model, and evaluate it.** Furthermore, the rationale behind each decision is detailed below."

I will investigate their distributions and assess whether there is a pattern in missing occurrences, that is, these records are missing not at random (MNAR), or if these records are missing completely at random (MCAR).\n",
    "- Once we construct dummy variables, it will not be necessary to apply feature scaling. One-hot encoding the features already scales them, assigning values of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "- In the EDA, we defined how the dummies would be constructed. That is, we observed the discriminatory power of each independent variable's categories to determine which would be the final categories for creating dummies. Essentially, we combined categories with similar discriminatory power (based on Weight of Evidence (WoE)), while balancing the number of observations falling into them. We did this to reduce the final dimensionality, improving our PD model's performance. The same approach was applied to continuous features, where we first applied feature discretization, observing the WoE across the ordered discretized bins. Therefore, now that the final categories are already determined, I will perform the same process here (feature discretization and categories combining), finally constructing the dummies we pre-determined and obtaining the prepared data for modeling."

    "- Furthermore, it's crucial to fit and transform only the training data to prevent issues like data leakage and overfitting, ensuring a reliable final performance estimate. Test data must only be transformed. Thus, the feature discretization and dummy creation will follow this guideline. That's why I am splitting it before encoding."

    "- As I mentioned above, we will perform feature discretization and categories bundling to obtain the dummies by applying one-hot encoding as we determined in the EDA step.\n",
    "- I will first obtain all final categories by applying feature discretization and categories bundling, and then one-hot encode everything.\n",
    "- An important observation is that, as it is necessary to create n-1 dummies for each independent variable, the preprocessors built already handle the removal of reference categories. This also applies to the imputation of missing values in 'mths_since_last_delinq' and 'tot_cur_bal,' treating them as 'never_delinquent' or 'missing' categories, followed by the creation of corresponding dummies.\n",
    "- The preprocessor classess responsible for performing these tasks are contained in the modeling_utils.py file. I have developed preprocessor classes to simplify the preprocessing steps, streamlining the entire process in an organized and modular manner. As we transition to the production environment in the future, a new comprehensive pipeline with more preprocessor components will be constructed, encompassing all the cleaning steps from raw data collection to now.\n",

    "- We will estimate our **Logistic Regression PD Model with hypothesis testing** to **obtain p-values for each coefficient**, determining whether a **predictor variable** is **statistically significant**. I am choosing this method to assess the statistical significance of independent variables and perform **feature selection**. Since we aim to construct an interpretable model, during this feature selection process, I will examine the statistical significance of dummy variables within an original independent variable. If any of the dummies are statistically significant, I will retain all the dummies for that independent variable. Omitting some dummies would compromise interpretability. To illustrate, consider wanting to assess an applicant's score, which is calculated using only grades A and E. Excluding any of the grades would diminish the meaningful interpretation.\n",
    "- Moreover, l1 **regularization** (Lasso) will be applied to prevent issues such as overfitting and enhance the stability of the model's predictions. Also, with Lasso is possible to perform a feature selection, once it reduces irrelevant variables coefficients to zero, generating a sparse model.\n",

It is calculated as $$ SE(\\hat{\\beta}_i) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_i)} $$, where $ (\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_i)) $ is the estimated variance of the coefficient. A smaller standard error indicates higher precision in the coefficient estimate. The standard error is crucial in hypothesis testing, as it is used to compute the z-statistic, which is then compared to a standard normal distribution to determine the significance of predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Distribution:**\n",
    "    - Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows a standard normal distribution ($ N(0,1) $).\n",
    "- **P-value:**\n",
    "    - The p-value associated with each coefficient's z-statistic is the probability of observing a z-statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- **Decision Rule:**\n",
    "    - If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "    - If the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "    - **Rejected Null Hypothesis:** If the null hypothesis is rejected, it suggests that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the predictor variable is a significant predictor of the response variable. In other words, the coefficient for that variable is significantly different from zero.\n",
    "    - **Failed to Reject Null Hypothesis:** If the null hypothesis is not rejected, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the predictor variable is a significant predictor of the response variable. The coefficient is not considered significantly different from zero.\n",
    "- **Significance Level (Alpha):**\n",
    "    - The significance level ($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. Commonly used values are $0.05$, $0.01$, or $0.10$.\n",
    "- **Wald Statistic:**\n",
    "    - The Wald statistic is another way to assess the significance of a coefficient. It is calculated as the square of the z-statistic and follows a chi-squared distribution. A higher Wald statistic indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- **Significantly Higher Than Zero:**\n",
    "    - If the null hypothesis ($ \\beta_i = 0 $) is rejected, it implies that the coefficient ($ \\beta_i $) is significantly different from zero. In practical terms, this means that the corresponding predictor variable is contributing significantly to the prediction of the response variable in the logistic regression model."

    "- **OBS:** \n",
    "    - 1. I analyzed the Logistic Regression with all constructed dummy variables and observed that the standard errors for variables such as 'grade_A' and 'sub_grade_A5_A4' were excessively high (e.g., 7.3e+05). Additionally, the presence of NaN p-values suggests a potential perfect separation problem. This occurs when a combination of dummy variables can perfectly predict the outcome, such as a combination in which all target values are 0 or 1. There are various ways to address this issue. Despite testing different l1 regularization alpha parameters, none proved effective. What did work was excluding the 'grade_B' variable from the dataset. Therefore, prior to feature selection and model fitting, I will eliminate this variable.\n",
    "    - 2. After fitting the model with the perfect separation issue resolved, I analyzed the p-values and observed that none of the dummy variables for 'grade,' 'total accounts,' and 'term36' were statistically significant, as they exhibited p-values higher than 0.05. Therefore, I will proceed to remove them."

    "- It is possible to see that our **scoring formula** from logistic regression has **86 dummy variables**. There are pros and cons to using a high number of features like this. The **cons** are that the **cost** of information acquisition increases, and it is harder to monitor after deployment. The **pros** are that with more variables, we have more **risk homogeneity in applicants' profiles**, which helps in distinguishing good and bad borrowers. Moreover, as time passes, in case one or more **variables** significantly **change** their **distribution**, with more variables, each one tends to **weigh less** in the model as a whole, and the **scoring formula** will be **less affected.**\n",
    "- **Some interpretation:**\n",
    "    - According to our definition of the good/bad variable, the event occurring is non-default, that is, being a good borrower. So, higher coefficients of the dummy variables in our PD models mean greater odds of being a good borrower, and, correspondingly, lower odds for default.\n",
    "    - Let's interpret, for example, the sub_grade variable. Considering the coefficient for sub_grade_A3_A2_A1 is 0.694287, we can infer that the odds of being good for a borrower with A1/A2/A3 subgrades are exp(0.694287) = 2.0 times greater than the odds for someone with G1/G2/G3/G4/G5/F2/F3/F4/F5 subgrades (reference category).\n",
    "    - We can also directly compare two dummies from the same original independent variable. Considering the coefficient for sub_grade_E5_F1_E4_E3_E2 is 0.163583, we can conclude that the odds of being good for a borrower with A1/A2/A3 subgrades are exp(0.694287 - 0.163583) = 1.7 times greater than the odds for someone with E5/E4/E3/E2/F1 subgrades."

    "#### 3.4 PD Model Validation\n",
    "- After constructing our PD Model using Logistic Regression with dummy variables, we need to **validate** that this model performs well on new, unseen data. To do this, we will assess the model's **performance** in our **out-of-time test sample (future loans)** by evaluating various things:\n",
    "- **Ordered Scores Assessment:**\n",
    "  - We aim for our model to exhibit **ordered scores**, assigning **lower scores to higher-risk borrowers**. The desired behavior is that as the score increases, the bad rate decreases. We will assess this by dividing the predicted probabilities into 10 equally-sized bins **(deciles)** and evaluating the bad rate along with other information such as the volume in each bin. This evaluation will be conducted for both the training and testing data.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "    1. **ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve):**\n",
    "        - The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (tpr, recall, or sensitivity) on the y-axis and the false positive rate (fpr, 1 - specificity, or 1 - tnr) for different threshold values.\n",
    "        - The area under the ROC curve (AUC) provides information about the **discriminatory power** of the model, indicating how well it distinguishes between good and bad borrowers.\n",
    "        - This score ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Gini Index:**\n",
    "        - The Gini index measures the **inequality** between good and bad borrowers in a population.\n",
    "        - It is defined as: $ \\text{Gini} = 2 \\times \\text{ROC-AUC} - 1 $.\n",
    "        - Similar to ROC-AUC, the Gini Index ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better discriminatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov):**\n",
    "        - The KS measures the **discriminatory power** of our model by indicating how well it distinguishes between good and bad borrowers.\n",
    "        - It is defined as the **maximum vertical distance** between the cumulative distribution function of the scores predicted for good borrowersand the cumulative distribution function of the scores predicted for bad borrowers: $ \\text{KS} = \\max[F_b(k) - F_g(k)] $.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Where:\n",
    "            - $ F_b(k) = \\frac{\\text{Number of bads with score} \\leq k}{\\text{Total number of bads}} $.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - $ F_g(k) = \\frac{\\text{Number of goods with score} \\leq k}{\\text{Total number of goods}} $.\n",
    "        - Similar to ROC-AUC and Gini, the KS score ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher value indicating better discriminatory power.\n",
    "    4. **Brier Score:**\n",
    "        - The Brier Score is a proper scoring rule that measures the **accuracy of probabilistic predictions**. In the context of predicting defaults, the Brier Score assesses the root mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes (0 or 1). It is particularly useful for evaluating the calibration of probability estimates, where lower scores indicate better calibration: \n",
    "            - $ \\text{Brier Score} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\text{Predicted Probability}_i - \\text{Actual Outcome}_i)^2 $\n",
    "- *Once the trend is not to use the scoring model as a cutoff point, like a rule for approval or denial, and it is preferable to classify individuals into score classes, adopting distinct credit policies based on default rate and profitability in each class, I won't assess metrics such as the confusion matrix, recall, and precision, which are based on a threshold (typically 0.5).\n",
    "- *All the metrics and ordering mentioned above will be also evaluated on training set to assess whether the model is overfitted. A model that generalizes well for new unseen data points must have similar train and test behavior and scores.\n"

    "#### 3.5 Scorecard and Credit Scores\n",
    "- Once the **PD Model** is built, it is essential to convert it into a **scorecard**. A scorecard essentially mirrors our PD Model, except that the **coefficients** are transformed into **scores**, integer values **easily interpretable** by individuals unfamiliar with statistical methods. Each dummy variable will be assigned a score, and the applicant's credit score will be obtained by summing the intercept score and the product of each dummy's value and its corresponding score.\n",
    "- The **definition** of the **score** **varies** across contexts and applications. Here, we will establish a **minimum score** of **300** and a **maximum score** of **850**. Naturally, a **lower score** indicates **higher credit risk**, and vice versa. Additionally, to derive these scores, various calculations will be applied as outlined in the code. These calculations were obtained from a reference of an experienced credit risk professional, Nikolay Georgiev.\n",
    "    1. First, we calculate the minimum and maximum coefficient sums, denoted as $ \\text{min\\_sum\\_coef} $ and $ \\text{max\\_sum\\_coef} $, respectively. These are obtained by summing the coefficients of the lowest and highest coefficient dummies belonging to each independent variable, plus the intercept.\n",
    "    - 2. Then, we calculate the scores as:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\text{coefficient} \\times \\frac{\\text{max\\_score} - \\text{min\\_score}}{\\text{max\\_sum\\_coef} - \\text{min\\_sum\\_coef}}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    - 3. Next, we compute the intercept coefficient as:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\left( \\frac{\\text{intercept} - \\text{min\\_sum\\_coef}}{\\text{max\\_sum\\_coef} - \\text{min\\_sum\\_coef}} \\right) \\times (\\text{max\\_score} - \\text{min\\_score}) + \\text{min\\_score}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    - 4. Finally, round everything to obtain integer scores, providing an easily interpretable credit risk assessment tool for non-statistical experienced users, the scorecard.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 5. Also, from these credit scores, we can obtain the sum of coefficients for a borrower: \n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\text{sum\\_of\\_coefficients\\_from\\_score} = \\frac{(\\text{scores} - \\text{min\\_score})}{(\\text{max\\_score} - \\text{min\\_score})} \\times (\\text{max\\_sum\\_coef} - \\text{min\\_sum\\_coef}) + \\text{min\\_sum\\_coef}\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "    - 6. And thus, his probability of being good through the logistic function:\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \\text{probability\\_of\\_non\\_default} = \\frac{\\exp(\\text{sum\\_of\\_coefficients\\_from\\_score})}{1 + \\exp(\\text{sum\\_of\\_coefficients\\_from\\_score})}\n",
    "        $$\n",
    "        \n",
    "- After constructing the final scorecard, I will compute the training and test data borrowers scores. Based on this, **credit policies** can be formulated to manage risks and maximize profits. I will design a credit policy and estimate financial gains after constructing the LGD and EAD models. These metrics can aid in the development of credit policies, allowing us to assess the expected ROI of a loan and assisting in the decision-making process of whether to approve or deny it. "

Additionally, I developed a **scorecard** by converting the PD model's coefficients into scores—integer values that make the results easily interpretable for users unfamiliar with statistical methods. Subsequently, I calculated the **credit scores** for each borrower in both the training and test sets.\n",
    "- The **model's performance** is satisfactory, demonstrating an **ordered distribution of scores** where, as the score increases, the bad rate and credit risk decrease. It exhibits **good discriminatory power**, with an **AUC of 0.7, a KS of 0.3, and a Gini of 0.4**. Furthermore, the **metrics** for both the **training and test** sets are **similar**, indicating that the model is not overfitted and will generalize well to new, unseen data."
