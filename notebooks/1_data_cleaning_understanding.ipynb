    "## Lending Club Credit Risk Modeling\n",
    "- In this project, I will build three **machine learning** models to predict the three components of expected loss in the context of **credit risk modeling** at the **Lending Club** (a peer-to-peer credit company): Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). The expected loss will be the product of these elements: **Expected Loss (EL) = PD * EAD * LGD.** The PD Model will be used to stablish a credit policy, deciding wheter to grant a loan or not for new applicants (application model) based on their credit scores. The EAD and LGD Models will be used along with the PD Model to estimate the Expected Loss (EL) from each loan in order to assess the capital the institution needs to hold to protect itself against defaults.\n",
    "- The PD modelling encompasses a binary classification problem with target being 1 in case of non-default and 0 in case of default. A Logistic Regression model will be built. \n",
    "- The LGD and EAD modelling encompasses a beta regression problem, that is, a regression task in which the dependent variable is beta distributed.\n",
    "- The **solution pipeline** is based on the **crisp-dm** framework:\n",

    "## Lending Club\n",
    "- **What is the Lending Club?:**\n",
    "    - LendingClub is a **peer-to-peer lending platform** that facilitates the borrowing and lending of money directly between individuals, without the need for traditional financial institutions such as banks. The platform operates as an online marketplace, connecting borrowers seeking personal loans with investors willing to fund those loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem: Managing Default Risks and Optimizing Returns\n",
    "- **What is the business problem?:**\n",
    "    - LendingClub faces a significant business challenge related to **managing default risks effectively** while **optimizing returns** for its investors. The platform facilitates peer-to-peer lending, connecting borrowers with investors, and relies on **accurate risk assessments to maintain a sustainable and profitable lending ecosystem.** Thus, the CEO wants us to provide insights about which factors are associated with credit risk in Lending Club's operations, and to construct models capable of predicting the probability of default for new applicants and possible losses on its loans in order to establish a credit policy, deciding when to grant a loan or not for an applicant. An important observation is that the CEO wants these models to be easy to understand. Since our company works on the internet, making customers happy and being clear is really important. So, we need to be able to explain why we decide to approve or deny a loan.\n",
    "- **Which are the project objectives and benefits?**\n",
    "    1. Identify the factors associated with credit risk in the form of business insights.\n",
    "    2. Develop an accurate Probability of Default (PD) Model, constructing a scorecard. This will allow Lending Club to decide wheter to grant a loan or not to a new applicant (application model), based on credit scores.\n",
    "    3. Develop Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) Models, to estimate the Expected Loss in loans. This will allow Lending Club to hold sufficient capital to protect itself against default in each loan.\n",
    "    4. Improve risk management and optimize returns by selecting a cut-off point or creating risk categories to approve loans based on our models' results. With this, we intend to establish a credit policy, trying to balance risk and ROI of Lending Club's assets.\n",
    "    5. Apply model monitoring and maintenance techniques to safeguard our results from population instability, characterized by significant changes in loan applicants' characteristics. This will allow us to understand whether the built model is still useful in the future or whether the loan applicants characteristics changed significantly, such that we will need to redevelop it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credit Risk Modeling Concepts: The Context of the Problem\n",
    "- **Financial institutions**, like LendingClub and online lending platforms, **make money by lending to people and businesses.** When they lend money, they **charge interest**, which is a significant source of their **profits**. **Managing credit risk well is crucial** for these institutions. This means ensuring that borrowers pay back their loans on time to avoid losses.\n",
    "- **Credit risk** is the possibility that a borrower might not fulfill their financial obligations, leading to a loss for the lender. If a borrower fails to meet the agreed-upon terms, it's called a \"default,\" and it can result in financial losses for the lender. The **default** definition is associated with a time horizon. For example, if a borrower hasn't paid their debt within 90 days of the due date, they are considered in default.\n",
    "- In the credit market, important **rules** help keep things honest and clear. **Basel III** is one such set of rules, making sure banks have **enough money (capital requirements)** and follow **guidelines for assessing loan risks**. The **Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB-A)** lets banks figure out credit risks using concepts like Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD). Another rule, **International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9)**, gives standards for measuring financial assets. It's special because it looks at the chance of a loan not being paid back over its entire life, unlike Basel, which checks it for one year. These rules help banks have enough money, handle risks well, and keep the credit market steady and trustworthy.\n",
    "- The **\"expected loss (EL)\"** is the average estimated loss that a lender can expect from loans that default. It involves three factors: the **probability of default (likelihood of a borrower defaulting)**, **loss given default (portion of the amount the bank is exposed to that can't be recovered in case of default)**, and **exposure at default (potential loss at the time of default, considering the outstanding loan amount and other factors)**.\n",
    "- **LendingClub**, operating as a peer-to-peer lending platform, uses a **\"PD Model/Credit Scoring Model\" to assess borrowers' creditworthiness using credit scores** from a scorecard. This helps determine the **likelihood of loan repayment**, guiding the decision to **approve or deny the loan.** The **required capital to guard against default** for each loan is calculated using **EAD and LGD Models** to estimate the **Expected Loss (EL)**, contributing to minimizing risk in credit operations.\n",
    "- When creating a Credit Scoring Model, which assesses creditworthiness for loan approval, using data available at the time of the application is considered an **\"application model.\"** It is distinct from a \"behavior model.\" This is the model I will build here.\n",
    "- A **\"credit policy\"** is a set of guidelines that financial institutions follow to evaluate and manage lending risk. It involves setting a cut-off point, a threshold based on credit scores, or risk categories, to decide whether to approve or reject loan applications. Another factors such as the expected ROI for each loan application are included.\n",
    "- **\"Return on Investment (ROI)\"** is a key measure of loan profitability. Balancing ROI with risk is vital for effective credit policy management. While higher-risk loans may offer more significant potential returns, they also come with a higher chance of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **this notebook** I intend to perform an **initial data exploration and data cleaning**, necessary to explore the data and build robust models further, encompassing the first and second steps of crisp-dm framework. The objective here is to convert features to the correct data types, initially remove unuseful variables, treat/diagnose missing, duplicate and outlier values, create new relevant variables and obtain a final memory optimized clean dataset for faster and more efficient analysis. Finally, the rationale behind each decision is explained in detail below."

    "    - If the **pattern of missing values is not random**, meaning that the occurrence of missing values varies between good and bad loans, for example, if there are proportionally more missing values in bad loans, it is advisable to treat it as a category within the feature. The absence of information from the applicant could be related to their intention to repay or not repay their debt.\n",
    "    - In case the **pattern of missing values is random, we can:**\n",
    "        - Remove these observations, in case we have a big sample of applicant data (and we have!) and their frequency is really low.\n",
    "        - Exclude variables with an excessive number of missing values (which we already considered doing).\n",
    "        - Keep the missing as one of the categories of the variable, like \"unknown\". It will have a weight in the final scoring formula.\n",
    "        - Impute values. Utilizing mean, median, mode or even inferring it from another variable highly linearly correlated with the variable with missings are possible alternatives.\n",
    "- The occurrence of **missing values** might be due to different **reasons**, like:\n",
    "    - The applicant didn't gave this information.\n",
    "    - The given information was not registered.\n",
    "    - The given information does not match with any of the expected codes or values for that variable, then, it was registered as a missing. This is pretty common in occupation, where some abbreviations come.\n",
    "    - The missing is, in reality, zero.\n",
    "- Let's investigate the missing values in relevant features below."

This simplifies our data processing, reduces the need for imputation or other treatments for missing values, and won't affect the results due to the substantial size of the dataset.\n",

The number of categories is important because it affects how we encode the data. If there are too many categories, using one-hot encoding can make the data dimensionality too big. This can be a problem. Also, I'll see if a variable is helpful or not. Sometimes, variables have too many categories and don't really help the model.

    "- I will apply an initial **data cleaning**, including the following tasks:\n",
    "    - **Treat missing values:**\n",
    "        - Null values in annual_inc, total_acc, acc_now_delinq, pub_rec, open_acc, delinq_2yrs, earliest_cr_line and inq_last_6mths make up a tiny part of the data (29 records, less than 0.0001%). Since I have a large sample size, I've decided to simply remove these observations. This simplifies our data processing, reduces the need for imputation or other treatments for missing values, and won't affect the results due to the substantial size of the dataset.\n",
    "        - There is no discernible pattern in the default/non-default distributions related to missing values in the emp_length variable. Moreover, we can reasonably assume that these instances correspond to consumers without professional experience. As a result, we will substitute these missing values with 0.\n",
    "    - **Remove irrelevant variables:**\n",
    "        - ids, url, desc, next_pymnt_d, last_pymnt_d and last_credit_pull_d will be removed because they are unuseful for the modeling or the analysis.\n",
    "        - application_type, pymnt_plan and policy_code will be removed because they are almost constant or constant, presenting no variance.\n",
    "        - zip_code, emp_title and title will be removed becasuse they present excessive cardinality.\n",
    "        - Variables with a missing rate higher than 70% will be removed in order to avoid bias.\n",
    "        - As mentioned above, variables like loan_amnt will not be available at the moment of prediction (production env) and thus will be removed to prevent from data leakage. However, once they can present valuable insights about credit risk in Lending Club's operations, I will do this in the data preprocessing step, after exploring them.\n",
    "    - **Convert variables to the correct data types:**\n",
    "        - Convert term and emp_length from object to int data type.\n",
    "        - Convert date related features from object to datetime data type. Considering that some features contain dates around 2016 and 2017, I will use 2017-12-01 as the current date for this feature extraction.\n",
    "- From the features I have, I will try to **extract new features**, obtaining the maximum amount of information from the available variables.\n",
    "    - default: This will be our target variable, indicating whether the consumer defaulted (0) or not (1). I will choose different loan_status categories to insert in default/non-default.\n",
    "        - I won't consider the grace period or late payments between 16 and 30 days in my definition of defaults. This is because, for customers falling into these categories, there's still a good chance they will repay their loans. It's too soon to label them as defaulters.\n",
    "        - I chose to represent non-defaulters as 1 and defaulters as 0. This is because, when interpreting our model, I want the coefficients to reflect a negative impact for defaulters, resulting in lower values.\n",
    "    - mths_since_earliest_cr_line: Self explanatory. It is interesting for us to obtain a numerical variable indicating the number of months since the earliest credit line."

    "    - Obtained a sorted dataframe, providing a chronological order for the loan data.\n",
    "    - Remove features with higher than 70% missing rate. \n",
    "    - ⁠Remove features with excessive cardinality.\n",
    "    - ⁠Remove features with an unique value for each observation.\n",
    "    - ⁠Remove features with no variance/constant value.\n",
    "    - Remove features that are unuseful.\n",
    "    - ⁠Denote there are features that will not be available at the moment of prediction (production Env) and must be removed further to avoid data leakage because they can drive valuable insights from the data. \n",
    "    - Remove observations with missings when they represent a very small portion of the data.\n",
    "    - Impute missing values when it should have a zero value.\n",
    "    - ⁠Convert features to correct data type (object to datetime and int).\n",
    "    - ⁠Create new independent features.\n",
    "    - ⁠Create the target feature based on a stablished default definition.\n",
    "    - ⁠Search and fix inconsistent outlier values based on min max describe.\n",
    "    - ⁠Optimize memory, obtaining a final parquet file.\n",
    "- As a result, we went from 75 features to a dataset with 42 variables in its correct data types, optimized in terms of memory usage, with some missing values and outliers treat and new useful extracted features. Now, the exploratory data analysis and modeling will be faster, more efficient and reveal better insights."
